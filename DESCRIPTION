A Quick and Simple PC Board Keep Alive

A Keep-Alive is a large capacitor, or string of capacitors that will keep a DCC-equipped locomotive running for a few seconds in the absence
of power to get over dirty track or a dead frog.  They can be used with most decoders.
Phil Edholm mentioned using a circuit found on the web instead of expensive offerings from decoder manufacturers
He started with something like https://www.dccguy.com/?tag=keep-alive
Note using a KA, other than the decoder manufacturersâ€™, may void the decoder warranty

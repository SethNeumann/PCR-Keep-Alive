A Keep-Alive is a large capacitor that will keep a DCC-equipped locomotive running for a few seconds in the absence of power to get over dirty track or a dead frog.  They can be used with most decoders.
Phil Edholm mentioned using a circuit found on the web instead of expensive offerings from decoder manufacturers
He started with something like https://www.dccguy.com/?tag=keep-alive by Dr. Larry Puckett (thanks Larry!)

We made some component changes:
Discharge Bypass Diode to Schottky 1N5819 (lower forward drop, less power)
Zener diode to 13V 1W 1N5243B 
Instead of 1/2W 100 ohm, used 2x220 ohm at 1/4W to save height and use a more available component

Note using a KA, other than the decoder manufacturersâ€™, may void the decoder warranty
